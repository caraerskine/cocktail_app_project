Description of App

"Friends, Let's have a drink tonight!" is a cocktail app of selected drinks. It is an app that is social in nature and hopefully is fun and interactive. A user can browse all the drinks and can even add their own drink. There is a "random drink" option too, so a user can use the element of chance to choose a drink.

I used event listeners for click events and submit events. My event listeners are:

DOMContentLoaded 
  It fires when initial HTML document is loaded.

Random drink generator button
Button to return to "All Drinks", two click events
  When a user clicks "surprise me" a random drink card will display.
  User can return to "all the drinks" after they get a random drink generated.  

User add new drink field, submit event
  A user can type in a drink and populate the fields so a new card will appear with their added drink.

Light/dark toggle mode button, click event
  When a user clicks "toggle dark mode" button, the background of the page becomes dark mode, when it is clicked again it returns to light mode. 

I included a reset stylesheet that is from an open domain to reduce styling problems with browser inconsistencies.

How to run it
  Open HTML file
  Run db.json file 
  You need JS to run it

I look forward to building more features into this app and increasing the interactivity:
  In the future I hope to be able to make a mouseover event, to mouseover a card and then the reverse of the card will display the drink ingredients. 

  In the future I would also like to modify the "ingredients" user submit field, so they can enter ingredients one by one and add the quantity and unit of measurement. 

  I would like to add a "like button" to keep track of popular drinks.
