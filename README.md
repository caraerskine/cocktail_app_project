Description of App
-What do we drink tonight
-random drink generator 

-This is my Cocktail Drink App

-Could I have a "random" button you can click to bring up a random drink?
(Is that hard?)

-If you type in a drink, and it exists, it will come up
-Otherwise it will say error 

-I want to have a search field where you type in drinks
-Search field also needs to clear out

-Can I add a feature where I like a drink
-A like button?
